# CSharpExperiment

Followed Microsoft's "Get Started" [Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/with-visual-studio-code).
<br>

Pain point: The command ```dotnet new console``` didn't work in VSCode. 
Solution: Rebooted computer -- apparently the environmental path didn't get updated/linked properly to VSCode after installing the .NET Core SDK.

Once the pre-requsites were set up I initialized a `C#` project. I like how doing this automatically generates a "Hello World" program for you as a starting point.
<br>

I was able to quickly set up a sample class (House class) and then in the Program class create a few
house objects to show how they can be operated on, the difference between static class variables and instance
variables, etc. 
<br>

It felt very similar to other OOP languages like `Java`. There are of course some differences but for someone
familiar with Java C# seems easy to pick up.
